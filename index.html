            <h1>Hello! My name is Saketh Pai.</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a self-taught programmer who works on a wide array of projects, ranging from small arcade games to command line tools. As of right now, 
                I am a student in Bengaluru. As my projects suggest, I am a very fickle-minded person, but when I take a project up, I will not rest until 
                I complete it.
            </p>

            <h1>What I'm Into (besides programming, of course)</h1>
            <p>
                My main pastimes are reading, writing short stories and playing card games. My favourite books include :
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Yellow King</li>
                    <li>The Harry Potter Series</li>
                    <li>The "A Song of Ice and Fire" Serires</li>
                    <li>Almost Anything by Lovecraft</li>
                    <li>Completely Anything by Rick Riordan</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                I also like to play retro games, such as the OG doom games, Flappy Bird, Mario and Pokemon (mainly from gen 3). The idea of having a whole interactive 
                world inside something as portable as a smartphone had always intrigued me and was what ignited my interest in programming.
